| :--- | :--- |
| affordance | the quality or property of an object that defines its possible uses or makes clear how it can or should be used We sit or stand on a chair because those affordances are fairly obvious |
| algorithm | step by step procedure to achieve a specific goal |
| argument | value that is passed into a function when it is called |
| array | a value that contains a sequence of other values |
| assignment | the act of putting a value into a variable= |
| Authentication | the act of validating that users are who they claim to be. |
| Authorization | a process of giving a user permission to access a specific resource\(s\) or function\(s\) |
| bash | command processor that usually runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a shell script. |
| bug | error, flaw, failure, or fault in a computer program |
| call | to run the code in a function |
| callback | a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. |
| canonical | in computer science, the standard state or behavior of an attribute. This term is borrowed from mathematics, where it is used to refer to concepts that are unique and/or natural. |
| compiler | program that converts code into an executable |
| constant | variable that never changes its value |
| constructors | The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created within a class. |
|  corner case | In engineering, a **corner case** \(or pathological **case**\) involves a problem or situation that occurs only outside of normal operating parameters |
| crash | to cause a running program to stop due to an error |
| debug | to investigate and fix bugs |
| declaration | code that declares that something exists |
| decoupling | a practice in which every part of your code is fully independent, and any dependencies are passed via arguments or injections. |
| definition | code that fully implements something |
| endpoint | The place that **APIs** send requests and where the resource lives, is called an **endpoint**. |
| explicit | Stated clearly and in detail, leaving no room for confusion or doubt. |
| function | a block of code designed to perform a particular task. |
| localization | **Website localization** is the process of adapting an existing **website** to local language and culture in the target market. It is the process of adapting a **website** into a different linguistic and cultural contextâ€” involving much more than the simple translation of text. |

| parameter | A numerical or other measurable factor forming one of a set that defines a system or sets the conditions of its operation. |
| Seperation of concerns | Design principle for **separating** a computer program into distinct sections such that each section addresses a separate **concern**. A **concern** is a set of information that affects the code of a computer program. |
| stack trace | A report of the active stack frames at a certain point in time during the execution of a program. |
| stateless | The client data is not stored on the server, the session is stored client-side \(typically in session storage\). |
